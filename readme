Registration and Login System Using File Handling in C++
This project is a C++ console-based application that demonstrates a simple yet effective Registration and Login System. It leverages file handling to store and retrieve user credentials securely. This system can be used as a foundational piece in building more advanced systems for authentication and account management.

Key Functionalities
User Registration:

Ensures that usernames are unique by checking against stored data.
Automatically generates a unique User ID for each account (e.g., MRW00001).
Implements password strength validation requiring:
At least 8 characters.
Uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
Stores user credentials in a file (record.txt) for persistence.
User Login:

Validates the username and password entered by the user against the stored records.
Provides feedback for incorrect credentials and offers the option to retry or register.
Forgot Password:

Allows users to retrieve their password by providing their username.
Confirms the existence of the account before displaying the password.
File Handling:

Credentials are securely stored in record.txt, maintaining persistency even after program termination.
User IDs are tracked using an id.txt file, ensuring uniqueness.
Decorative UI:

Text-based UI with headers for each page (Login, Registration, Forgot Password).
Prompts and messages are designed for an intuitive user experience.
How It Works
The program starts with a menu offering four options:
Login
Register
Forgot Password
Exit
Based on the user's choice, the respective function (e.g., login(), registration(), etc.) is executed.
File operations are used for reading and writing user credentials.
Use Case
This program serves as a basic blueprint for user authentication in small-scale applications. It can be integrated into larger systems or used for educational purposes to understand file handling and password validation concepts in C++.

Files Used
record.txt:
Stores user credentials in the format: UserID Username Password.
id.txt:
Keeps track of the last generated User ID.
